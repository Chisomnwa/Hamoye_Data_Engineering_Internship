# This is a repository for my Hamoye Data Engineering Internship Stage Quizzes

## For Stage A:

This [notebook](https://github.com/Chisomnwa/Hamoye_Data_Engineering_Stage_Quizzes/blob/main/Stage_A_Quiz.ipynb) file contains my Tag along code for the stage A assessment quiz.

This quiz was an assessment of our understanding of the **Introduction to Python for Machine Learning Course.** The 60-minute quiz had sections numbered 1â€“20 where we imported, wrangled, and answered some questions on the African Food Production Dataset which was provided by the FAO website.

This food Balance Sheet compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations contains a selection of African countries food supply between 2014 to 2018.

This food balance sheet shows the food items for human consumption, along with how much was produced, used, imported, or exported, and how it benefits society (per capita supply).

The dataset can be obtained via this link: [FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv](https://github.com/HamoyeHQ/HDSC-Introduction-to-Python-for-machine-learning/files/7768140/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv)

**Please note!:** For some reason, GitHub imposes a 5-second timeout for rich rendering. If the notebook cannot be rendered within the timeout period of 5 seconds, GitHub does not render it. It happens to big and small files as well. If you could not view the codes on the Stage_A_Quiz.ipynb, you can easily view it on Jupyter nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/Chisomnwa/Hamoye_Data_Engineering_Stage_Quizzes/blob/main/Stage_A_Quiz.ipynb).
